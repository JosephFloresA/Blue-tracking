Project Summary – Blue Track

The Challenge
Marine ecosystems face increasing threats from climate change, overfishing, and pollution. Yet, there is still no integrated system that combines satellite observations and animal tracking to predict the behavior of key marine species such as sharks. This lack of integrated information limits the development of evidence-based conservation policies and increases risks in human–wildlife interactions.

Our Solution – Blue Track
Blue Track is an innovative web application that integrates NASA satellite data with shark tracking information to analyze and predict shark feeding habitats. Using datasets from NASA missions such as PACE, MODIS-Aqua, and SWOT, we incorporated variables including temperature, chlorophyll concentration, ocean currents, air pressure, humidity, and wind speed.

The platform visualizes shark trajectories and environmental conditions through interactive maps built with Mapbox, allowing users to explore six months of shark movement data (2013) along the U.S. East Coast. These layers reveal relationships between shark presence and ocean productivity patterns.

AI and Predictive Modeling Vision
In future iterations, Blue Track aims to scale globally by dividing the ocean into data grids. Each grid would apply machine learning models or polynomial regressions to estimate the probability of shark presence based on environmental variables, generating predictive maps and conservation alerts in real time.

Impact
Blue Track provides a scientific foundation for public policies on ocean conservation, pollution control, and marine health, transforming satellite data into actionable ecological intelligence.
